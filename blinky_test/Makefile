# The CC variable typically represents the C compiler that will be used during the

# compiler is being used for compiling the C source files in the project.

CC = avr-gcc

# Compiler Options:

# -Wall:
# This flag enables a set of warning messages during compilation. It helps to
# catch potential issues or suspicious code constructs that might lead to bugs
# or undefined behavior.

# -Os:
# This flag optimizes the generated code for size. It instructs the compiler to
# perform various optimizations that reduce the code size, although it may have a
# slight impact on execution speed. This is often desirable for resource-constrained
# microcontrollers where minimizing code size is important.

# -mmcu=atmega328p:
# This flag specifies the target microcontroller for which the code is being compiled.
# In this case, it is set to the Atmega328P microcontroller. The compiler uses this
# information to set the appropriate processor-specific options and generate code
# tailored for the specified microcontroller.

# -std=gnu99:
# This flag sets the C language standard to C99. It instructs the compiler to use the C99
# standard for language features and syntax. The C99 standard introduced several new
# features and improvements over previous versions of the C language.
